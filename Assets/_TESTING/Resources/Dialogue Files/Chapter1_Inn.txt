Clementine "Finally, out of that storm! {c} Now let's just hope they have a room here." 
Billy "Let's find out. {c}Hello?{a} Is anyone here?"
narrator "Stepping out from a room in the far back of the lodge, a tall, gruff man took his place behind the counter"
Innkeeper "That's a nasty storm out there. {c}But I don't need to tell you that, it seems."
Narrator "The man let out a hearty chuckle and offered the two girls a drink."
Innkeeper "If you came looking for a room, I'm afraid the most I can offer you is a hot drink and seat by the chair"
Clementine "You mean, you have no vacancies?"
Innkeeper "I'm afraid not.{a} The last room was taken this morning. I'm afraid I don't have anything else available"
